1- clone the repo
2- run composer update
3- create a database and update .env database cnfigurations
4- run php artisan migrate --seed (admin user will be created with email: admin@gmail.com and password: password)

 Design pattern
 --------------
 service pattern

 	1- UserService class (create user function)
 	2- TransactionService class (create transaction & retrieve transactions depending on logged in user role)
 	3- PaymentService class (create payment function)
 	4- ReportService (generate report within given range)

Middelware
-----------
Admin middleware 

cronjob
-------
updateTransactionsStatus command was created and used in scheduler to run daily to update transactions status
